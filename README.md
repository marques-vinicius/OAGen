# OAGen
OAGen is an experiment that uses a Large Language Model to generate OpenAPI Specification (OAS). We tested two approaches: with and without Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

The files in this repository are the replication package for the OAGen experiment:
- Replication package for the OAGen experiment.pdf: contains guidelines for creating the prompts and pipelines.
- MarquesVinicius-DevBotsCanCoDesignAPIs.pdf: contains the paper describing the experiment.
- /samples/ComRAG-1.json to /samples/ComRAG-10.json: OAS produced by the RAG pipeline. "Com" means "With" in Portuguese.
- /samples/SemRAG-1.json to /samples/SemRAG-10.json: OAS produced by the pipeline without RAG. "Sem" means "Without" in Portuguese.
